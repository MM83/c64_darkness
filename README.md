# DARKNESS
A C64 game set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Essex, 1986

This is my first serious attempt at making anything on the Commodore 64 since getting it to repeatedly print a swear word was considered a feat of programming genius, around 25 years ago.

*I am essentially making it up as I go along, after spending a few months screwing around with various tutorials. Whilst this method of development is not exactly recommended, the nature of 6502 assembly code forces me to build a program in discrete functional blocks, it's very hard to cater to whims when you have to get a pen and paper out to plan the smallest operation, and for this reason, it's actually quite easy to come back to after a period of time, something I can't say about any other project/language.*
